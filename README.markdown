A Z-machine interpreter in Python and a Skype plugin to use it over the web.

Before attempting a more complex emulator I thought this would be a good exercise. That's why I'm writing it from scratch. I'm aware of zvm (http://code.google.com/p/zvm/) and I might later on try to integrate my code with their (incomplete) interpreter. But for now I'll keep it a seperate project.
