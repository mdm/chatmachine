a verb with one or more nouns. For instance, to see where you are type "look".
Some verbs can also have more elaborate forms; for instance you could also look
at, inside or under something. "Curses" understands about 1200 English words,
so most reasonable synonyms are allowed.

To pick something up, "take thing" and to drop it again, "drop thing". To see
what you have, type "take inventory" or just "inventory". You can move about
with commands such as "go west", or just "west" for short. (It is assumed that
you are blessed with an excellent sense of direction.)

"

"drop all", which will drop everything (except things you're wearing), for
instance. Or if you found a packing case with a number of things in, you could
type such things as:

    remove everything but the blue key
    get all the coins except ten, twenty and fifty

(Containers may also be emptied or emptied into each other.)  If you are not
explicit enough, sometimes the game can infer what you mean, but at other times
it will ask for further details. It might have replied to the first line above
by saying

    (from the yellow packing case)

You may either tell it which, or else give up and do something else instead. If
you don't mind which key, you can always say something such as:

    drop a key into the slot

and the game will make a sensible choice and tell you what it was.

"

implicitly make, but always tells you what they are in brackets. For instance:

"her" to anyone obvious in the room; "pronouns" will tell you what they
currently mean, if in doubt. "again" repeats the last command.

You can "save", "restore" or "restart" the game at any time, or indeed "quit"
or ask for your "score", which also tells the time. "fullscore" or "full" gives
a breakdown of the score. As an aide-memoire the command "objects" tells you
where you left things you once had, and "places" says where you have been. "

is intact (and not, for instance, corrupted by some file-transfer process you

time, and nor does anything the game didn't understand.

"

places, and they can type "short" (or "superbrief") to make the game only give
short ones. Amnesiac players, on the other hand, may like to use "long" (or
"verbose") to give only long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state

want to talk to if you miss off the name. A better way to talk, which allows
more complicated remarks, is to use commands such as

Alexandria, produced the first library catalogue: a 120-part organised history
of literature to date (almost all lost now, like much of its subject matter).
He was favoured at court and celebrated for his epigrams (about 60 of which
survive in the "Greek Anthology") but denounced by critics for being unable to
write epics, which he detested ("big book, big bore"). Apollonius, the head
librarian c. 260-247, was a former pupil with exactly opposite views, who
brought out a 6000-line epic on the Argonauts, whereupon the quarrel grew so
personal and bitter that Apollonius was driven into retirement."

were lost, though, and now no-one can remember why."
2de74: S055 "The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a
relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden
floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these
teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric
light."
2df24: S056 "A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in
from below."
2df54: S057 "There is a closed trapdoor in the middle of the floor."

2dfa4: S061 "It was to have been the Honourable Peter Meldrew's life's work, a
two-volume edition giving the definitive family history. Unfortunately,
although he claimed to have hunted for evidence to the ends of the earth, he
never could find a detail he wanted for volume I, and it was never published.
Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your
ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite
achieving anything.

Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children. So many Meldrews
are listed here that you'll have to look them up individually."
2e114: S062 "What a boring old book!  There's nobody worth looking up."
2e138: S063 "an"
2e13c: S064 "A graceful lady's box, bearing the initials A. M. and engraved

by the open trapdoor."

2e1ec: S067 "Actually a four-leafed sprig of herb paris (Paris Quadrifolia) in
the shape of a fourfold true-love knot. But that was good enough for Alison."
2e24c: S068 "Not much use as it is, is it?"
2e260: S069 "Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little
crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent
danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west.
A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this
warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep."
2e33c: S070 "Hobson's"
2e344: S071 "Lots of naughty words in that one."
2e35c: S072 ""Hobson's: A Choice Classical Dictionary". It claims to have

2e3b4: S074 "an"
2e3b8: S075 "This is an old Biblioll College scarf, made by Dunn and Co.
(naturally). It has four stripes: royal blue, emerald, dark grey and scarlet."
2e414: S076 "An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway."
2e434: S077 "The very height of fashion, if you ignore the colours and wear it
regardless."
2e464: S078 "A tight door stands open in the northern wall, giving onto the
servants' staircase."
2e494: S079 "Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs
coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg
missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway
the attic continues to the southeast."
2e534: S080 "The attic turns from north to southeast here."
2e550: S081 "Nothing there, but that cupboard looks interesting."
2e570: S082 "It has a calm, soothing effect."
2e584: S083 "A patent "Harrison" bird-whistle, according to the slogan on one
side."

2e610: S088 "It is addressed to the house, and postmarked 1963, but has no
message. Odd, that."

2e658: S090 "These bottles can even survive long drops, so perhaps you should
try fire."
2e688: S091 ""Antidote only: no preventative effect.""
2e6a4: S092 "This drug is for fun, it isn't an antidote. And it tastes
gorgeous..."
2e6d4: S093 "The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather
empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight
doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the
south."
2e758: S094 "(Aunt Jemima has two cats, Jane and Austin, but she finds Austin
especially annoying - about the only point you have ever agreed with her
about.)

Austin, a ginger with a long tail and an uncompromisingly lazy expression, is
the kind of cat who hates being pushed around."
2e7fc: S095 "Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here."
2e824: S096 "This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your
grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the
chemicals out in case the children found them."
2e894: S097 "The only doorway is back east."
2e8a8: S098 "the old"
2e8ac: S099 "Mounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man."
2e8d0: S100 "The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it
was taken in the dark because the chemicals have gradually oxidised. The poor
man in the frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a
big clamp to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was."
2e97c: S101 "It is attached to the ceiling."
2e98c: S102 "You bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the
umpteenth time."
2e9b8: S103 "Things do look subtly different in this light."
2e9d4: S104 "When you can get this working, perhaps you should take it
somewhere prominent."
2ea04: S105 "The kind of black box which often sits on top of a camera, used to
illuminate otherwise dim scenes. It has an openable compartment on the side,
with room left inside for a battery and a timer mechanism (which seem to be
optional extras)."
2ea90: S106 "A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one
side."
2eac0: S107 "Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a
telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south."
2eb98: S108 "It isn't at all clear on what principle the detector works. It
looks like a smoke detector, certainly. But you just left the contractors to
sort out all those boring fire prevention matters for themselves.

They were a slap-dash firm, too, from what you remember. They put the little
white thing high up, right in the middle of the Capricorn scene on the mural.
And even if there was a fire, chances are it would be useless."
2ec94: S109 "Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid
glass ball."
2ecc0: S110 "Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and
all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny,
with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with
the central heating."
2ed50: S111 "From here, you can only squeeze back east to the observatory."
2ed74: S112 "The joint on the water pipe looks none too sturdy."
2ed90: S113 "Don't bother reading or thinking about it. Nothing to do with your
family."
2edc0: S114 "A romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and
they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time
you called a plumber to sort this one out."
2ee30: S115 ""Coronets for the Cotton Girl", by Miss Marie Swelldon, published
London, 1912. It's all about the happy-go-lucky daughter of a Yorkshire mill
owner and her adventures marrying into the aristocracy."
2eeb8: S116 "My my, a golden age for clear, simple poetry. At last, an end to
the dreary obscurity of Tennyson, Kipling and Hardy."
2ef04: S117 "This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the
family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly
earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide
projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of
the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory."
2efd0: S118 "It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding
whatever is to be projected. There is also a little dial on the back, perhaps
for the focus."
2f028: S119 "some"
2f02c: S120 "That is a difficult puzzle, yes."
2f044: S121 "In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step
inside."
2f070: S122 "In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door."
2f094: S123 "The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty
it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping
gear."
2f0ec: S124 "It might be handy, if only it could carry anything."
2f110: S125 "Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your
famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the
Zambezi Expedition of 1882!"
2f17c: S126 "On second thoughts, now you look at more closely, it seems to be
the rucksack you bought to go to Paris with five years ago."
2f1c8: S127 "A secret door stands open in the south wall!"
2f1e4: S128 "The secret door is closed."
2f1f4: S129 "A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open
and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)"
2f24c: S130 "This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall
ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room
for something..."
2f2ac: S131 "Carry this with you everywhere you go."
2f2c4: S132 "A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century
ancestor, is propped up against the west wall."
2f308: S133 "It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged
eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous
idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't
and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here."
2f3a8: S134 "There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall."
2f3c4: S135 "The medicine bottle, alas, was undamaged by the fall down the
chimney."
2f3f0: S136 "The skylight above is open, and the sky does indeed light the
room."
2f418: S137 "Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle."
2f43c: S138 "It was painted out black during the first wave of Zeppelin air
raids in World War I. This is completely irrelevant, but you did ask."
2f490: S139 "The cork filters have gone. It's useless now."
2f4b0: S140 "This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but
screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An
open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However,
the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it
especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the
south."
2f58c: S141 "William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in
tranquillity. If so, hospitals must be full of people turning out verses about
what it was like to fall off the roof of a high building. Perhaps it might be
better not to join them."
2f628: S142 "The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home
is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these
military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also
weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back
southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here."
2f6f8: S143 "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
2f718: S144 "Unfortunately, what you need this for is up in the clouds."
2f73c: S145 "He is dressed in a grey shadow of Georgian finery."
2f760: S146 "the ghost of"
2f768: S147 "The chimney is cramped, sooty, unpleasant and has no floor to
speak of, so you are held up only by jamming your feet against the walls. To
the east, through the fireplace, is the cupboard."
2f7dc: S148 "Not a chance!"
2f7e8: S149 "Wedged loosely in beside you is a sooty old stick."
2f808: S150 "It's exactly what it seems."
2f81c: S151 "Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was
always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from
a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this
spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the
supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney."
2f8f8: S152 "An open hatch-door in the wall at floor level reveals a chute
leading down into darkness."
2f934: S153 "Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open
would be large enough to enter."
2f970: S154 "Perhaps the attic key might unlock it?  It does look modern
compared to everything else here."
2f9a8: S155 "an"
2f9ac: S156 "The really good research was in his earlier years."
2f9cc: S157 "The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer
book."
2f9f8: S158 "Despite appearances, this is not a prayer book after all but is
Mad Isaac's diary of supernatural investigations!  The script is cursive and
cursory as he rambles on through all those theories about the Curse. There's so
much of it that you'd better just look up particular years."
2faa8: S159 "There's just the secret north door, unless of course you count the
windows."
2fad4: S160 "Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day."
2fafc: S161 "Blue sky can be seen through south-facing windows, latticed with
black lead and shut tight."
2fb34: S162 "Evans is content once again."
2fb48: S163 "There is a long vanity mirror beside the bed."
2fb64: S164 "A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air,
blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway
in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good
reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north."
2fc10: S165 "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
2fc30: S166 "You look down on a low, bare window-sill."
2fc4c: S167 "The balcony is only a foot or so beneath the window-sill, and only
about four feet square."
2fc84: S168 "Gold and lead are naturally related, so you want to find a lead
box to open."
2fcb4: S169 "This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all
manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps,
provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the
banister rail continues along a passage east."
2fd4c: S170 "Faded ink on the label reads: Elderberry '63."
2fd6c: S171 "It's provided for your torch, and not for anything else."
2fd90: S172 "On the side is the word "Achtung"."
2fda8: S173 "Purely decorative."
2fdb8: S174 "The good news is that it has excellent grid references, which are
easy to look up. The bad news is that it is a map of central Hamburg."
2fe08: S175 "This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took
it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery.
She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a
home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south
is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can
hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing
nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west."
2ff68: S176 "A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain
odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One
corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's
infamous Sixties Revival period of last October."

her somehow."

full of coal dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to
linger."

30f04: S308 "Remember the late 1970s, when a craze for home-made robots swept
the home computing world?  No, perhaps not, but here is a left-over from it
anyway. The mouse is quite large (almost a foot wide and tall), and has a big
smile painted on its metal chassis. It has surprisingly modern circuitry in,
though, and is even humming very faintly, so someone must have put some work in
on it recently."
30ff8: S309 "This is the eastern end of the cellars, from which you can only go
west."
31020: S310 "The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is
a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this
with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for
you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do
you."
310d4: S311 "It isn't the attic key, I fear."
310e8: S312 "Brass is of course a non-magnetic copper-zinc alloy, so presumably
this key also contains iron."
31128: S313 "Lying where the mouse dropped it is a small brass-coloured key."
31150: S314 "The west end of a disused and shadowy old cellar. It was bricked
up when you were a child - you never did find out why. Perhaps the golden,
jewelled staircase leading down into smoky mists to the south might be
something to do with it."

doors, each harder to pass than the last. This one, though, has a feeling of
the ultimate about it."
31284: S319 "An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn
with great spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead
white insects. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of
the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc
about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking
for must be somewhere near here."
313b8: S320 "There is now a small spherical opening in one wall."
313d8: S321 "It would just hold a ball the size of your palm."
313f4: S322 "A cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and glowing with vivid,
golden light, so bright it almost hurts your eyes. A narrow crevice opens out
to an iron doorway and the relative darkness of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc
about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity)
symbol."
314d4: S323 "A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an
Egyptological craze was sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust
passage to the east."
31530: S324 "A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the
disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to
the British Museum. A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while
the entrance seems to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the
northern face let in dim light."

staircase."

316f4: S332 "Leaned against one of the eight corners is a ragged white
parchment scroll."
31724: S333 "What taste! What artistry!"
31738: S334 "A lamentably naff tourist's gift, this seems to be a "replica" of
one of the papyri on which some lost Greek play or other was written. Some
nonsense about the priestess of Apollo being summoned by music, etcetera.

It has all the charm of a tea-towel of, oh, say the Taj Mahal made out of
curry."
317f4: S335 "A little charcoal sketch is framed on one wall."
31814: S336 "Behind the frame seems to be an artist's impression of the great
Palace of Alexandria as it might once have been."
3185c: S337 "It's the frame which really sets it off."
31878: S338 "Charcoal is so unrealistic, don't you agree?  Besides, it's far
too large and clumsy."
318b4: S339 "A miniature artist's impression of the great Palace of Alexandria
as it might once have been.

(No, the impression is miniature, not the artist.)"
31914: S340 "The ravings of a madman. Ignore it."
3192c: S341 "A low, white hallway adjoining the Octagon, converted from what
was once the scullery and the servants' pantry. A tight, dark staircase runs up
and south; and a diagonal bricked path runs out northeast to the gardens."
319b0: S342 "Up on one wall is a picture hook."

31a10: S346 "There's an old-fashioned elephant's foot umbrella stand beside the
garden doorway."
31a44: S347 "This dark, steep staircase zigzagging through the house once gave
the servants access throughout. But those days are long gone and now all the
doors are locked up."
31aa4: S348 "This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of
despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The
street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement
building."
31b30: S349 "This shambolic flat, extending to the east, shares a filthy
hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the
street. Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the
walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent."
31bd0: S350 ""Bateaux Phlebas - toujours le dernier mot". You briefly wish you

31c6c: S352 "Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and
stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel,
caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't
help standing on tiptoe here."

Mary looking up at the light."

31eec: S363 "an"
31ef0: S364 "The bottom corner is signed simply "Helene"."
31f10: S365 "The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by
incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead
curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an
electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack."
31fa8: S366 "Peculiarly, the hanging curtain seems to be solid iron when you
walk into it."
31fdc: S367 "She has a bad cold, but nevertheless is known to be the wisest
woman in Europe."
32010: S368 "Hood, scythe, skeleton, implacable grin: yes, it's the Reaper all
right."

of a cliff."

320e8: S375 "Shoddy workmanship, but never mind, it's only a staff and who
needs those any more?"
32120: S376 "Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by
unpleasant rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around
you."
32178: S377 "People had no style in those days, before they invented paper
tissues. I mean this tatty cloth is hardly attractive, is it?"
321c8: S378 "On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk
handkerchief."
321f8: S379 "Monogrammed J. A. P., but that's no great matter."
32218: S380 "The side reads: PHLEBAS."
32230: S381 "Moored close to the bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat."
32254: S382 "On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you
like to explore, you can't see how to attract its attention."
322a0: S383 "A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore
to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy,
almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and
casts his eyes to windward."
3233c: S384 "the"
32340: S385 "Every now and then he whimpers."
32354: S386 "The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my
big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down
Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old
destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the
hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time.""
3243c: S387 "A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so
full of black-suited pedestrians off to work at banks that you can't force your
way any further east. Once in a while a few of the bowler-hatted army step into
the street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign."
324ec: S388 "You can't force your way through the tide of bankers."
3250c: S389 "This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns,
deep beneath the streets. You are outside the ticket gates, near a flight of
steps back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're likely to stay
that way."
32594: S390 "Back up the stairs for you. Call yourself a traveller..."
325b8: S391 "Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and
maps."
325e4: S392 "His jumper is unstriped, and there are no onions around his neck.
Nonetheless he has a rather Gallic, disgruntled look to him. Perhaps he's a
former Socialist cabinet minister."

32668: S394 "What a very useful map!  Now you can go on holiday."
3268c: S395 "Just the way you remember yours having been."
326a8: S396 "The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly
lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and
rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like
bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked
off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor."
3278c: S397 "There's no apparent way but south."
327a0: S398 "Why not go northeast and look inside?"
327b8: S399 "A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see."
327e0: S400 "One of those pretentious exhibition posters. Your German is just
about adequate to the task:

"Cults of the Druids - a Major Retrospective, October-November 1988"."
32850: S401 "Inside one quarter of the cramped revolving door, which is blocked
off from the world outside and opens only onto the foyer, southwest."
3289c: S402 "To north and east are the walls of the door."
328b4: S403 "The door only turns clockwise."
328c8: S404 "You stand within it."
328d4: S405 "A colourful, striped inflated beach ball bounces around."
328fc: S406 "A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are
square lintelled doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are
high, but there's just enough light to see by."
3296c: S407 "There's nothing worthwhile in it."
32980: S408 "Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box."
329a0: S409 "A long painted still life graces one wall near a corner."
329c4: S410 "A disturbing painting, perhaps by Edvard Munch, this is a still
life of a seedling on a table, surrounded by a rusty iron rod with a star on
the end, a glass bottle, a lamp and a bunch of keys. No doubt these arcane
objects held some special significance for primitive tribes now absorbed into
civilisation."
32a80: S411 "A dark staircase, turning from east to south as it descends. The
hideous sound of arhythmic chanting can be heard from below."
32acc: S412 "On one step, an empty matchbook lies discarded."
32aec: S413 "Ah, I fear it is only a token clue."
32b04: S414 "It's from the Ruined Castle Cafe, and (like the Cafe) is
matchless."
32b30: S415 "A stone castle on a hill."
32b44: S416 "It leads nowhere."
32b50: S417 "A single bright light in the darkness."
32b68: S418 "Ugh, what a nasty bright light. Good thing you'll never go there."
32b90: S419 "There's less to this card than meets the eye."
32bac: S420 "Andromeda chained to a rock on the sea-shore."
32bcc: S421 "What an ugly girl!  Bet she's good for a laugh though."
32bf0: S422 "It leads nowhere."
32bfc: S423 "It shows a great many crystal-glass cups and glasses."
32c20: S424 "An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into
a prison cell: amateur but effective."

32c78: S426 "an"
32c7c: S427 "Just a crook. And what's wrong with crooks, that's what I say."
32ca8: S428 "As you might expect, the cell door is closed."
32cc4: S429 "An annexe to the museum, containing sundry archaelogical finds,
badly labelled in German (which you can hardly read at the best of times) and
securely pinioned inside glass cabinets. The storm outside thrashes against the
narrow dark windows."
32d58: S430 "One cabinet looks particularly vulnerable."
32d78: S431 "You could just look inside the broken glass cabinet."
32d98: S432 "A smooth palm-sized disc, perhaps of pumice stone, painted in
yellows and browns with a single star motif, around which (clockwise) are the
words "nog", "er", "ska" and "iw". If you remember the label rightly, something
funny has been done to a piece of metal embedded in the top, but your German
wasn't up to understanding what."
32e68: S433 "Doesn't the shape strike you as familiar at all?  - There, that
should point you in the right direction."
32ea4: S434 "You need more evidence before you can begin deciphering the
language, I fear."
32ed4: S435 "Only one line has survived intact:

32f38: S436 "This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to
the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and
arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the
cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays
Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a
waiter are very slight."
3301c: S437 "The crowd is lively and exciting, but also inconsiderate and
bulky."
33048: S438 "It contains a timer-detonator, a bundle of plastic explosives and
many, many wires. The most obvious ones are green, red, blue and black. They
would pull out of their loose sockets in the timer easily, so perhaps this bomb
disposal nonsense isn't as tricky as people make out."
330f4: S439 "Taped loosely to the underside of the table is a
complicated-looking bomb."
33120: S440 "Time flies down here, you know. Eternity simply breezes by."
33148: S441 "Good photographic gear that. You didn't get it from a... well, a
bomb, I hope."
3317c: S442 "This basement room is filled with crate after crate of glasses and
cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might
be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is
at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is
shut tight."
33234: S443 "There's no apparent way out of here."
33248: S444 "Through the square window in the door you can see a bar at which
staff are serving, and a very crowded and lively cafe-restaurant beyond. The
cabaret act has her back to you, and a considerable amount of her front to the
diners."
332cc: S445 "numerous"
332d4: S446 "Old, unwanted, dusty, empty."
332e8: S447 "The great challenge, of course, is to get a ship inside."
3330c: S448 "An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a
wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates."
33358: S449 "Oh, well done!  Why not take a closer look, you deserve it?"

nobly out to sea as she awaits her fate."

now."
33560: S460 "On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous
slither down leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even
more hazardous. Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle
lighthouse, but there is no way in from here.

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave
mouth."
33630: S461 "There's only dull grassland that way."
33648: S462 "A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west
to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy
mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a
path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind."

wife Livia, who painted the figs on his tree with poison. Actually it looks
like a perfectly nice piece of fruit."

fig."

33858: S471 "A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed
men who are drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north
door, but they strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight."

massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring
about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to
the north."

33af4: S484 "Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred
earth into the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy
walking on such hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting
cross about that sort of thing."

33ba4: S486 "The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble
pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the
north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if
Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

badly, to write it all out twice."

broad bas relief depicting the seasons: the planting of seed, high summer, the
harvest, floods and then the coming of ice."

reel from one side to the other, hanging onto the rail, grabbing at the mast or
the rigging. Nobody else seems to be aboard. The boat makes no headway in a
strange, glassy mist.

The mast rises dizzyingly high.

You can't even make out the water below. A great pink haze spreads across the

insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British
Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of)."

carved and painted figurine and named the "Lady Magdalena". There is no sign of
water, but the boat is rocked too often for it to be aground. And the glassy
mist hangs ahead."

good-luck token: a green-leafed branch, to attract the gulls of an approaching
shore."

were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast

the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew
Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn."

patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the
mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments

corner of the garden least visible from the house."

woman."

"Self-Portrait, H.M. '54". (It's presumably not by Her Majesty the Queen,
though.)"

the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well."

down."
35108: S584 "This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then
covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists
of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes
of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your
family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no
further."

surprisingly well."

privet hedges of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an
opening in the wall makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small
vegetable garden."

garden. The patch testifies more to good intentions than horticulture."

here."

353d0: S594 "At the top of the beanstalk, in amongst the clouds. There is no
safe way to go from here except back down, not surprisingly. A dangerous way
might be to step out onto the clouds to the north, but even if this is a
fairy-tale it would be taking a lot on trust."

nineteenth century, and yet they still planned some marvellous gardens."

many warning labels about getting it on one's hands."

for such an implement?"
35634: S604 "Hanging from a hook is a bladed agricultural implement."

the branches and leaves which surround you. You can make out Aunt Jemima up at

missing flagstone offers an intriguing dark prospect beneath."

down (unfortunately) to the motorway below. Coaches pass by, reminding you of
the rapidly approaching time when visitors will have to be let in again for the
summer. The only safe way to go is back east into the maze. To one side is a
plaque."

358cc: S617 ""This viewpoint, one of the finest in the county, was laid down by
Capability Meldrew, a well-known landscape gardener of his day. It was intended

earlier folly on the site collapsed.""

playing card?"

stand on the hillside outcrop."
359f0: S621 "This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east.
Down below in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in
the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.

Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The
freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The
latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe."

outer rooms of Meldrew Hall to a track through the eastern side of the garden."

garden, crowned with a summer house to the north, widening out to a broad
croquet lawn east."
35cdc: S630 "A flock of sparrows crowds around the gutters of the summer house.
Every now and then one flits up and lands somewhere else, and they bustle about
chirpily."
35d3c: S631 "An old wooden summer house, reeking of varnish and uncertain
beneath your feet. Several segments of the tall glass many-sided pyramidal roof
are missing and others are cracked, but this is still somehow a homely and
welcoming retreat. The only entrance is also the only exit."
35de8: S632 "Croquet is the Devil's own game!"
35e00: S633 "It's for mashing croquet potatoes."
35e18: S634 "A croquet mallet stands by one wooden wall."

stare for hours..."

but it's too high up to reach."
35ebc: S638 "Among dense hedges by the shabby wood-slatted back of the summer
house. Dark scratchy branches hem you in, but you could scramble down to the
west or out onto the croquet lawn southeast."

summer house."

central peg. These ones have been safely anchored in place since the lawn was
laid out in, oh, Midsummer 1923 if family lore is to be believed."
36094: S647 "A good strong strongbox, buried for two centuries and now
unearthed; it bears a fine gothic iron lock, and a tasteless coat of arms (a
wild boar rampant)."

perhaps?"
36124: S649 "A very old instrument for measuring altitudes, this is all that
remains of Sir Joshua Meldrewe's stolen hoard of gold. There is an eyepiece."
3617c: S650 "A mighty fine instrument, though not much use hand-held."

none of these pastoral consolations is yours as you scrabble in the dirt."

and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of
the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries,
Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of
Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.

This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not
dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly
to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an
Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or
anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe
Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur."
36488: S656 "An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only
natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is
also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness."
36500: S657 "The crags are too precipitous."
36514: S658 "You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an
overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On
the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that
they are not friendly."

365bc: S660 "A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the
crags."

shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft
in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be
traversed to the east.

It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp
frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires
illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign
of civilisation."
36704: S662 "The hillside is too steep."
36714: S663 "You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an
Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and
Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the
Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and
devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries
old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to
west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door."
36838: S664 "A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here,
to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years
time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A
rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at
the lowest point of the tiled roof."
368f8: S665 "You climb the ladder and are about to jump onto the roof when you
catch sight of a man swaddled in animal furs, spreadeagled over the tiles,
looking down into the central courtyard of the villa. He has a nasty-looking
sword and since he hasn't seen you, you quietly shin back down the ladder
again."
369a4: S666 "The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a
fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters
in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back
north."
36a24: S667 "Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on
a long spear-like pole."
36a5c: S668 "The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north
side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The
central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into
individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust.
There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight."
36b34: S669 "The four quarters show white-beards in the Forum, farmers in
Italian fields, a military fortification and a grain ship unloading at Ossia."
36b8c: S670 "Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently
home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough
blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the
guards are absent."
36c18: S671 "A crude six-sided die made from animal bone."
36c34: S672 "a pair of"
36c3c: S673 "What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted
and long since ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century,
and this villa wouldn't be easy to defend.)  A doorway to the east gives onto
the atrium."
36cd0: S674 "The well has a hinged wooden cover. You can't tell by looking how
deep it is."
36d00: S675 "The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about
a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside."
36d44: S676 "In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is
shut."
36d70: S677 "You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous
well. You can hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously
enough you feel warm air blowing across you from the east."
36de0: S678 "Too risky. There might not be anything that way, for all you
know."
36e08: S679 "This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access
space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating
for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very
warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.

A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to
see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came."
36f04: S680 "The log fires are hot, and anyway the only way out large enough
for you is back west."
36f38: S681 "the"
36f3c: S682 "A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by
lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of
men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to
yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew Hall will one day be built, men on
horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is
certainly well-guarded."
3702c: S683 "Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent
of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a
central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were
blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires
outside the tent."
370e0: S684 "This tent doesn't seem to have an exit, either."
370fc: S685 "He is dishevelled, wiry and unconscious. He is also covered with
dust and leaves, as if he has been lying down on his front outdoors for hours."
37154: S686 "An unconscious Saxon spy is slumped on the ground. Occasionally
faint noises can be heard from him."
37190: S687 "Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched
at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried
out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so
surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide.
Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim."
37264: S688 "Far, far too risky."
37274: S689 "An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to
make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an
almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals."
372e0: S690 "You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible
noises and incantations of a druidic rite."
37320: S691 "Far, far too risky."
37330: S692 "I wouldn't wave that around if I were you!"
3734c: S693 "Resting on top of the dolmen is a polished blue stone."
37370: S694 "You are transparent like a ghost."
37388: S695 "It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires
burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost,
and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent,
but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the
embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."
37460: S696 "This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has
an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at
five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers,
junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their
distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent."
37534: S697 "This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears
entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside
it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs."
375b4: S698 "Primal, bestial, terrifying."
375c8: S699 "An absolute essential."
375d8: S700 "On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind."
375f8: S701 "The mascot is in the shape of an ankh, with a lemniscus (or
infinity) symbol moulded onto it."
37634: S702 "Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too
walks in this strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes,
of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so
often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then
look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and
yet... they treat her with respect."
3772c: S703 "You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are
sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false
good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there
will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there
is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem
unaware of it."
37818: S704 "A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on
top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel
irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out..."
37894: S705 "A strangely familiar, dusty passage, sloping down from a southern
end bathed in hostile light to some kind of metal barrier in the north."
378e8: S706 "Flurries of green luminescence whirl endlessly around you, west to
east and over."
3791c: S707 "The flurries have almost endless fascination... but you manage to
tear your eyes away after, oh, an hour?"
3795c: S708 "Your ghostly self is embedded in a diagonal downward shaft
(descending to the east) entirely filled with dry sand. Solid flagstones line
the walls."
379b8: S709 "Flaming torches bracketed in the wall gutter as the last oxygen in
the air is consumed, and the flicker of flame plays across the yellow-orange
glaze of the tomb walls.

This octagonal chamber is lined with Egyptian hieroglyphics. Sand spills across
the floor from under the sole entrance, sealed by an ingenious stone slab."
37a78: S710 "some"
37a7c: S711 "A kind of ship's wheel (of eight-spoked timber) is affixed to the
northwest wall."
37ab0: S712 "A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light
streams in from the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on
show."
37b08: S713 "The mural stands slightly to one side, revealing a passage leading
downward."
37b38: S714 "The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the
test of time."
37b64: S715 "The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the
western sky. He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a
bundle of wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols
of all kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations."
37c0c: S716 "An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to
murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with
bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the
east."
37c90: S717 "You appear to be standing on a wrought iron key."
37cac: S718 "A figure-eight double ring, a long barrel and a finely-cut
ten-groove claw: this is the ultimate in keys. It is superb."
37cf4: S719 "A long, winding, vile passage through the earth, running east to
west. The distasteful odour grows stronger as you go east."
37d40: S720 "Well, perhaps "sarcophagus" is a little melodramatic, but it's
that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You
are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken
only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place."
37dec: S721 "Nightmarishly, even the floor you kneel on is a fallen tombstone."
37e14: S722 "The gist of the inscription is: "Henri Maladreue, obiit mcdlvi.""
37e40: S723 "A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie.
Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a
peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an
uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west."
37ee8: S724 "You bumped into something unpleasant there."
37f04: S725 "Leading down."
37f10: S726 "an"
37f14: S727 "The odd smell seems to be ozone, and it drifts up from a
previously concealed aluminium staircase."
37f50: S728 "The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of
fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights,
cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills
the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall
which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The
parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east."
38078: S729 "The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured
metal."
380a4: S730 "Someone rather good-looking (you can't help thinking) is reflected
in the metal surface."
380dc: S731 "How tantalisingly valuable it seems."
380f4: S732 "Solid, heavy, reliable, out of reach on the other side of the
glass."
38120: S733 "You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's
cave, the hub of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently,
according to his or her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being
science, there is only a black metal one-metre cube with an unimpressive
collection of gauges and dials. An aluminium staircase leads up."
38200: S734 "The lower, on, position is labelled "Determinism". The upper, off,
position is labelled "Chance"."
38240: S735 "Particularly prominent are a large dial, like the volume control
on an expensive hi-fi amplifier, and a big electrician's switch. Both are
labelled in small print."
382a8: S736 "Above the dial is a lower-case letter h with a slashed line
through it. It is currently turned to 1.055 or thereabouts. There is something
worryingly dangerous about its matter-of-factness."
38320: S737 "A treasure in every sense, but misted over, like condensation on a
cold window. Odd shapes seem visible through the haze: a horse's head, castle
walls, a priest's crook."
3838c: S738 "Sitting on the grass, beside the well, is a glowing golden orb."
383b4: S739 "You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten
yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow
insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm
pearly light."
38444: S740 "Images lurk about the array of oblong crystals."
38464: S741 "an"
38468: S742 "They are extremely hard to see and impossible to touch, as if you
can only catch anything at all through the corner of your eye."
384b4: S743 "A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the
Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north).
The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city
(southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration."
38560: S744 "The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are
named, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit
sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two
scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously
if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour."
3866c: S745 "The causeway is the only land route off the island."
38688: S746 "The Pharos is unclimbable, alas."
386a0: S747 "That iron key seems to have washed up here..."
386c0: S748 "...and there's the strange stone again."
386dc: S749 "A rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating lies open here."
38700: S750 "In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron
grating, closed up tight."
38738: S751 "The iron key, out of reach below, is glued somehow to the strange
stone."
38764: S752 "Interestingly, a key which looks as if it would fit the grating
can be seen inside the passage beneath."
387a0: S753 "Oh dear, surely it's gratingly obvious what this fits?"
387c4: S754 "Down on a dark stone jetty, where the waters of the Alexandrian
harbour splash insistently. Rough-hewn steps rise up the island through the
grating."
38820: S755 "A skiff (a small sail-boat) is moored up here."
38844: S756 "You could easily sail away: where you would end is at the mercy of
the tides and the night breeze, since you have no idea how to guide a rudder or
trim a sail."
388a0: S757 "an"
388a4: S758 "A cardioid of the kind favoured by Valentine's cards rather than
surgeons.

It reminds you oddly of one of the symbolic pieces in Monopoly - the ship, the
hat and so on."
38910: S759 "There must be more to this marvellous figure somewhere."
38934: S760 "An adamantine heart lies in the skiff."
38950: S761 "As the skiff passes the jaws of the Royal Harbour, beneath the
great Pharos light, you have a final view of the receding civilisation of
Alexandria: ahead lies the vast, oil-calm Mediterranean and moonlight on the
waters."
389d4: S762 "The skiff is not under your control."
389e8: S763 "You drift in the wide, peaceful Lunar sea. Curious fish, their
yellow-green eyes gleaming beneath the silver ripples, brush past your wake:
the night zephyr is almost slack but still you drift. Minutes pass like hours
in paradise."
38a78: S764 "You feel only a drug-like calm."
38a90: S765 "The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria,
greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from
the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis
gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city."
38b30: S766 "A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some
brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it
is ancient. Most of the little termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded
time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south."
38be8: S767 "This is no place to wander after dark."
38c00: S768 "some"
38c04: S769 "Birds of prey circle high in the night sky, their talons glinting
in the moonlight."
38c34: S770 "You stand near the tombstone to which the birds of prey were so
inexplicably drawn."
38c64: S771 "You stand near the tombstone, which has become rather more
interesting now that a flight of steps downward has appeared."
38ca8: S772 "It bears just one word of epigram: "GALITA". Below that is a
curious face, with an open empty socket of a mouth."
38cf4: S773 "An amber gem gleams in the mouth of its face."
38d14: S774 "Are you sure it isn't inside out?"
38d2c: S775 "A cloak of many colours lies folded on it."
38d48: S776 "A fine cloak, grey-lined, sapphire-encrusted, rippled across with
rainbow fabrics from the trade routes of the world."
38d90: S777 "A fine grey cloak, sapphire-encrusted, lined with rainbow fabrics
from the trade routes of the world."
38dcc: S778 "Ransacked, dimly-lit, cramped and empty, this rough-built and
uneven burial mound is to the Great Pyramids of Giza (built just a century
before) what the summerhouse in your garden is to Windsor Castle. There are
only dull painted writings, an unpleasant odour and a passage out to the
north."
38e84: S779 "some"
38e88: S780 "One of the so-called Pyramid Texts making up the so-called "Book
of the Dead". This dramatic passage seems to be devoted to wise men preparing
their bodies to rise in the afterlife, anointing themselves with oil. An
interesting motif of ten strokes, arranged

catches the eye."
38f44: S781 "A perfectly-cut room of rose-coloured granite, twelve feet across,
painted in yellows and browns to simulate alabaster panelling. This is the
latest in modern funerary apartments.

There's a couch for visitors, a table, a flight of steps up and a doorway to
the west, flanked by two stone sphinxes."

39060: S786 "One of the sphinxes does have rather a prominent nose, it must be
said."
3908c: S787 "Splendid."
39094: S788 "A perfectly-cut room of rose-coloured granite, twelve feet across,
painted in yellows and browns to simulate alabaster panelling, at the foot of a
flight of steps which leads only to a sealed wall."
3910c: S789 "No grave would be complete without one."

their lanterns over the riches of the tomb."

the Nile Delta, and carry fine brass lanterns."
39220: S796 "The passage, descending from the east down to the west, is cut
from marble, lined with painted scenes from the fashionable comedies of
Menander, decorated with Alexandrian coloured glass ornaments.

The expression "You can't take it with you" doesn't seem to be popular
hereabouts."
392c8: S797 "Just an east-west passage."
392dc: S798 "You simply can't bear to look. It might be a monkey... at least it
has a tail... No. No, you have to look away."
39324: S799 "Despite the tasteful decor, the most hideously ugly model animal
you have ever seen sits on a little shelf here."
3936c: S800 "Oh dear."
39374: S801 "Exquisite. Simply charming."
39388: S802 "The passage opens out onto the burial chamber below."
393a8: S803 "Unfortunately, the passage slants down only into a solid marble
wall."
393d4: S804 "A really luxurious burial chamber, far beneath the entrance court.

A yard-wide square channel runs away fractionally east of north, in an
apparently endless stooped passage.

On the west wall are three curious sockets, above a painting of a priest of the
half-mythical pharoah Sosostris in full sceptred, grey-clad regalia."
394a8: S805 "The passage rises sharply to the east."
394c0: S806 "Drawn in the odd aspect favoured by the Egyptians, who believed in
ideal angles rather than accurate drawing. The sceptre, only half the size of
the large ones you once saw in the British Museum, looks oddly familiar.

This close to the wall, you notice words written above the three sockets."

39640: S813 "A copy, half-size, of the one from Tutenkhamun's sarcophagus. It
isn't real gold, either."
3967c: S814 "Of no use to anyone these last two thousand years, sorry!"
396a0: S815 "The great lid of the coffin is open."
396b8: S816 "You lie in the mummy case, your arms folded across each other,
face grimaced, running out of air rapidly and with almost no room to maneouvre.
The coffin lid is about ten times heavier than you, and its seal is very good."

hand."
397d0: S821 "The great Stadium of Alexandria, with capacity enough to hold the
whole population of the city: and it looks full. Olympic openings in the age of
television have nothing on these people. The procession surges continually in,
around the track and then out again, and amid the bustle you cannot push
through."
39884: S822 "It would be easier to breathe back southwest."
398a4: S823 "Tragically, the Theatre is closed tonight, but roads lead past the
great stepped bowl: north toward the Palace, south to the Museum and west to
the harbour-front."
39904: S824 "The main southwest-northeast road forks off with a road due north
to the Theatre. Despite the kaleidoscopic din you are impressed by the sober
majesty of the Museum of the Ptolemies, whose fine portico entrance, decked
with reliefs, is southeast."
39998: S825 "Reliefs of the cat-god bestride the square-cut entrance. The
fanaticism of the cult of the Cat in Lower Egypt has such a stranglehold that
the image is everywhere. You remember reading somewhere that passers-by in the
street have been torn to death before, just on suspicion of mistreating a
sacred cat."
39a50: S826 "This is not the famous Alexandrian tower (which is not due to be
built by the Emperor Domitian for centuries), just an anonymous little monument
on the same site. It is square-cut inside and there's only a small exit
northwest."
39ad8: S827 "The heavily defaced door opens onto a staircase up."
39af8: S828 "In one wall is a door heavily defaced with writings, the same
word, over and over in a hundred tongues and scripts: the word "Sosostris", in
fact."
39b54: S829 "The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by
incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead
curtain leads east. In the centre of the room is a table, which is bare."

walk into it."

familiar about it."

tomb's builders: a useful length of greenish oak."

39d10: S838 "Ready to use."
39d1c: S839 "For me? Oh, you shouldn't have... oh, you didn't. Well give it to
someone else then."

knight placing a rose in his lady's hair. Quite nauseously romantic."

warehouses. The Mediterranean laps darkly against the hard, splashing an
occasional wave up the slope. The city, and the party, lie back east."

possessed of hundreds of thousands of books: where the ruling Ptolemies keep
fanatic, infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival
commentaries on the ancient poems - hence the nickname.

There is a little door to the south; a dusty corridor southeast; a thoroughfare
east, and a grand entrance northwest."

3a0b8: S855 "Oh my. Well, the plot, um, there are seven attackers, all with
different shields, one for each of the seven city gates, and it's a civil war
so of course the brothers are really in a duel and there are champions and the
women are upset but it's all because of their brother who was really their
father... Never mind. It's strictly for aficionados."

3a1b8: S857 "This small, dark (by night) room is a repository for Library

3a3bc: S864 "Once the polar axis of a globe."
3a3d0: S865 "A spacious, densely colonnaded corridor, its walls lined with
inset shelves on which are scrolls beyond count, ribboned, dusty,

argument about something. They seem well practised at this occupation."

3a818: S882 "A hugely impressive edifice, and everything you might expect from
the man who conquered the whole of Asia Minor at an age when most people are
starting to think about getting a mortgage.

There are of course guards, but they're trying to catch the procession, so if
you're careful not to draw attention to yourself you could probably sneak in to
the north."
3a8ec: S883 "Scholars are divided on the origin of the "maze" legend: some hold
that to a primitive culture, the Knossos palace was so complex as to seem a
maze, and the king so fearsome as to seem a Minotaur.

Others say the early palaces really were labyrinths to protect sacred altars.

And you think it's because this is a maze of twisty little passages, all
alike."
3a9cc: S884 "Such a slave, a highly trained professional, stands at every
intersection of passages in the palace. They are deaf mutes, to prevent them
overhearing State secrets."
3aa34: S885 "A slave stands impassively by one wall."

Alexandria. In two hundred years' time, Julius Caesar will be besieged here,
and will hold the palace with a tiny force of men against an entire army: and
will lose his heart to Cleopatra...

For the mean time, this is a broad stone balustraded balcony. The coin-bright
moon, low in the sky, reflects off the black waters far below."

doors to the heart of the palace are sealed shut."

3abd8: S891 "At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane
approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only
makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public
footpath, to northeast."
3ac78: S892 "Better not - they might catch you."
3ac90: S893 "The fire escape is perilous and leads nowhere. Doubtless it would
be useless in any real fire."
3accc: S894 "The Hall is in the way."
3acdc: S895 "The old carved southern wall of the gardens blocks your way around
the edge of the Hall."
3ad10: S896 "For the first couple of storeys, an old iron zig-zag, and after
that a ladder that might or might not be well-anchored. The gardeners have done
a good job of concealing it behind wistaria which (in any case) looks the
stronger of the two."
3ad9c: S897 "By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the
village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view
of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and
dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be
pleasant."
3ae54: S898 "The footpath turns from southwest to north."
3ae70: S899 "A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in
the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go
northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge."
3aeec: S900 "There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow."
3af0c: S901 "A bunch of nuts, left over from last autumn."
3af28: S902 "Do you know, I love nuts, but I have to be so careful what I eat
now... Still, the little ones will have them."
3af70: S903 "Nuts to you too."
3af7c: S904 "Entwined in the nest is a bunch of nuts."
3af94: S905 "And sat upon it is, as you might expect, a bird: a corn crake, in
fact."
3afc0: S906 "A rail with a distinctive cry. And a possessive look."
3afe4: S907 "Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of
the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The
village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing
to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory
tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall."
3b0b4: S908 "You wander around the peaceful green for a while, but there's
nothing to do."
3b0e0: S909 "Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the
memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper."
3b134: S910 "In the band of his hat is his lucky mascot: a little picture of
the crescent moon."
3b164: S911 "Old Evans' hat is empty. You feel terribly guilty."
3b188: S912 "The stone cross, for the fallen of the Great War of 1914-18,
contains more names than there are houses in the village.

Your eye is caught by Second Lieutenant Gerard Meldrew of the 19th/21st Rifles,
and you shiver, although the afternoon is warm."
3b228: S913 "The fourteenth-century Church of St Michael and All Angels doesn't
seem to be locked up, exactly - just barred from the other side."
3b280: S914 "In the days of Oliver Cromwell, it was called "God Encompasseth",
but the locals have worn down the name over the centuries to "Goat and
Compasses". It is of course closed, owing to the licensing laws. You
congratulate yourself on living in such a modern, forward-looking country."
3b32c: S915 "The monkey sits on Evans' shoulder, cheeping with excitement.
Evans has found a pet, and is so gruffly delighted that he has forgotten all
about the mascot you stole. Now if he could only predict the 3.40 at Borchester
Mills..."
3b3bc: S916 "Some kind of crescent moon, an old Druidical symbol."
3b3e0: S917 "It leads nowhere."
3b3ec: S918 "The front page story ("Lord Lucan's new acquisition Shergar comes
out of retirement to win the Grand National") is so boringly unsensational that
you quickly lose interest. But Evans is eternally fascinated with minute
details of the form of the horses, tomorrow's race meetings, current odds
quoted by the bookmakers, and so on."
3b4b8: S919 "Racing aficionados consider it lucky to wear mascots in the bands
of their hats."
3b4e8: S920 "Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it
was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of stone, filled with
dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the
lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to
the south.

Old side chapels lie east and west."
3b5c4: S921 "The church door is open."
3b5d4: S922 "the"
3b5d8: S923 "A passage slants down through a solid crystal doorway in the
Moonstone."
3b604: S924 "Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an
ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon."
3b658: S925 "The Moonstone is very old, probably pre-dating the rest of the
church by some centuries. Legends about it abound: some say the spirits of the
departed pass beneath. Old iron rings are set in it, but nobody has ever
succeeded in lifting the colossal weight."
3b6f4: S926 "An alcove in the ancient west side of the church, beneath stained
glass windows of the Resurrection."

3b7e0: S934 "The knight stands clasping the flower."
3b7f4: S935 "The knight stands staunchly here."
3b808: S936 "A small clear space to the side of the church, in a bay ringed
with stained glass windows of the Nativity."
3b848: S937 "The church lies west."
3b858: S938 "A tall marble statue of Diana stands here: a find from the nearby
Roman remains."
3b888: S939 "There is a sly look in her eye as she smiles aslant."
3b8a8: S940 "The bell-ringing chamber, half-way up the church tower. Thick
braided ropes hang down, tailing into sashes. A plaque on one wall announces
that in 1901, ten men (Roger Meldrew among them) rang a Kent Triple Bob."
3b930: S941 "The ropes are too smooth and noisy to climb."
3b94c: S942 "eight"
3b950: S943 "There is a beautiful view over the green parceled farmlands and
hills surrounding the village, and you feel a certain pride to see Meldrew Hall
sitting amongst it. It's also windy and dangerous up here on the grey lead
spire of the parish church, beside the old clock: fortunately an opening leads
down into the clerestory."
3ba0c: S944 "an"
3ba10: S945 "Like a solid glove.

It reminds you oddly of one of the symbolic pieces in Monopoly - the ship, the
car and so on."
3ba5c: S946 "There must be more to this marvellous figure somewhere."
3ba80: S947 "Mounted loosely on the end of the weathervane, an adamantine hand
points the way the wind blows."
3bab8: S948 "William Snelson's"
3bac8: S949 "The clock stands at ten past three, as it has done for some years.
According to a small commemorative plaque, it was the work of William Snelson
the Clockmaker (1776-1848)."

misunderstanding completely."
3c69c: S996 ""Zeus wasn't a true god, of course," the angel predictably
